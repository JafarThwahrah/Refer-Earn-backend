## Introduction

The Refer and Earn App is a platform designed to empower users by enabling them to refer new users and earn points whenever their referred contacts successfully register on the application. To ensure the integrity of the system, participation is limited to registered users with the 'user' role. Upon completing the registration process, each user will be assigned a distinct referral link. This personalized link can then be shared with potential recruits to encourage them to join the application as well
